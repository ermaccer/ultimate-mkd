<p align="center">New characters, stages and more!</p>


# Intro

Ultimate Mortal Kombat Deception is a modification for PS2 version of Mortal Kombat Deception. A custom PCSX2 fork provides easier way to edit code and also more available RAM.

### NOTE: Current PS2 support is experimental, if it works it works - unless you find a crash that's easily reproducible I'm afraid there's nothing that can be done!

# PS2 vs PC
PS2 support was added in the V3 version of UMKD, it is currently experimental and some features have been cut when compared to the PC (emulated) version.

## Cut features
- In-game menu (L3)
- No camera options
- No NPC select to save on bytes
- No ini configuration


## Konquest mode

Since the mod pushes PS2 executable hard enough, it is not recommended to play Konquest on the UMKD modded version of MKD.
